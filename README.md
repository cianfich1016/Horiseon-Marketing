# Horiseon Marketing Refactor

Horiseon Marketing is a webpage with information and links to specific sections that navigate the user to what they desire to learn regarding best marketing practices. The codebase has been modified to create a logical structure meeting accessibility and functionality standards to allow for optimal search of the webpage.

Semantic elements were added as well as logistical structure rearranged for enhanced readability. The attribute "alt" was added to images. Headings were properly ordered. A concise title was created. Comments were added to both the index.html and the style.css sheets.
